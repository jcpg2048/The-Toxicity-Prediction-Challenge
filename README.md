# The-Toxicity-Prediction-Challenge
Our project is focused on creating a model using machine learning algorithms to predict if the chemicals are toxic. Newly synthesized chemicals must undergo toxicity testing before being released in the market. It is impossible to detect toxicity using conventional laboratory animal testing with thousands of new chemicals being synthesized every day. 

Main file is where the data preparation , data preprocessing and model selction code is present. GridsearchCV consists of parameter selction code.
